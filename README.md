# Isabelle Villasenor's Completed Application 

This was an optional practice from Turing's Backend Program that provided 10 User Stories that each student had to build a working app around. 

## General Application Background

The intention of this application if for users to coordinate which trails they will be using for a day hike. This will test your ability to set up many-to-many relationships and access attributes and methods through those relationships.

### Constraints:

- Visitors will go on many hiking trips
- Each hiking trip is made up of one or more trails
- A trail may be part of more than one hiking trip
